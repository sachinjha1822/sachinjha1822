# Sachin Kumar Jha — Software Engineer (Full-Stack & API Systems)

Remote-ready software engineer focused on building scalable web platforms and API-driven systems. I work across frontend and backend with strong emphasis on clean architecture, performance, and modular service design.

I have hands-on experience building commerce platforms, REST APIs, and multi-module applications using React, Flask/Django, PHP, and SQL databases.

Currently expanding into Go, GraphQL, and cloud-native tooling for high-scale distributed systems.
